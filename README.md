# Memoro

Project carried out for master's degree. 
Web application (frontend side) written in Angular 14.

Main object was to implement simple application to support learning and effective memorization of information.
The SM-2 (SuperMemo2) algorithm was used for this purpose.

## Description

Memoro is an application that enables much more effective learning using techniques and tools such as memory information extraction, forgetting curve and spaced repetition. 

It works on the basis of fiches. Users can create their own collections and fiches for learning. 

The SM2 algorithm determines the optimal repetition time maximizing learning results. 

There are also graphs / statistics (e.g. from the number of cards displayed / learned) and also functionality to share collections with other users.

## Technological stack

**Angular** and **TypeScript** - core technologies

**RxJS** - library for reactive programming using Observables

**n2-charts** - library used to display charts and statistics

**Angular Material** and **Bootstrap** - libraries used for styling
